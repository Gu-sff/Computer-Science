/*1*/Society in every state is a blessing, but
/*2*/government, even in its best state, is but a
/*3*/necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable
/*4*/one: for when we suffer, or are exposed to the
/*5*/same miseries by a government, which we might
/*6*/expect in a country without government, our
/*7*/calamity is heightened by reflecting that we
/*8*/furnish the means by which we suffer.
